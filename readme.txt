Easily 301 redirect any page or URL on your website to a new location anywhere on the internet.

== Description ==

Wildcard redirect support coming soon!

WP-301 is the long-awaited answer to easily implementing 301 redirects on your WordPress website without needing to manually edit your .htaccess file. In other words, with this plugin, you can manage ALL of your redirects from within the WordPress control panel. There is absolutely no need to login via FTP, as the redirects are performed by sending 301 commands directly via server headers (rather than using the outdated wp_redirect code).

= Features =
* Works fine with both PHP4 and PHP5
* Supports most special characters (foreign languages)
* Wildcard redirect support coming soon
